# learning-Datastructures-and-Algorithms
**Learn everything from basics of c programming to Algorithms and excel your software engineering skills**

This is the part of my rule - CodeDaily (code atleast one hour). 
I ll be doing all the topics below progamms and pushing them . Find them above.

Lets start with a Quote to keep you going,
> Eveyrone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think - Steve Jobs

## Basics of C Programming :-
- Inroduction
- Flow Control
- Functions
- Arrays
- Pointers
- Structures and Unions

## Data Structures :-
- Stacks
- Queues
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Hashing
- Heaps
- Graphs
- Binomial Heap
- Fibonacci Heap
- skip list
- Trees
- Red Black Trees
- Ternary Search Trees
- Segment Trees
- Splay Trees

Once we ve done with DS lets Jump off to Algorithms

## Algorithms
- Analysis
- Sorting and Searching techniques
- Divide and Conquer
- Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Complexity Classes

oohh now lets solve some problems using datastructures and Algorithms

## Problems solving using Data structures and Algorithms

- Stacks
- Queues
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Heaps
- Strings
- Divide and Conquer
- Backtracking
- Bit Manipulation
- Mathematical Algorithms
